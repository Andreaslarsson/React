This is just a very basic wepage that can do what it says in inl√§ming.
I have structure in the folders "components" and "src" and have 3 viwes.
One is the index and from there you can go to home and about to get new viwes. i alos made a form with a useStat hook yo handle the data.
On the Index viwe i also have a image from google weblink and a table all off this comes from "components" map and gets renders in App.js.
